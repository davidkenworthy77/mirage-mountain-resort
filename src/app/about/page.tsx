Jake grew up skiing Mammoth and always wondered why Southern California didn't have its own mountain. After a decade in outdoor hospitality startups, he drove up Palomar Mountain on a whim, stood at 6,100 feet looking out at the Pacific, and called his investors before he got back to the car. He hasn't stopped talking about it since.",

She's overseen the installation of Mirage Mountain Resort's snowmaking infrastructure, trail design, and lift systems.

He's responsible for the brand voice, the retro poster aesthetic, and the Onesie Rule.

                  Palomar Mountain has been here for millions of years. It has hosted
                  one of the most important observatories in the history of astronomy.
                  It gets snow most winters. It sits at 6,100 feet above sea level,
                  90 minutes from the beach, in a county with 3.3 million people and
                  zero ski resorts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jake Caldwell noticed this. Or rather, he couldn&apos;t stop noticing
                  it. A former competitive skier turned outdoor hospitality entrepreneur,
                  Jake had spent years building experiences in places people already
                  went. But Palomar Mountain kept nagging at him. The elevation was
                  real. The snowfall was real (30+ inches of natural snow in a good
                  year, with records topping 120 inches). The market was very, very
                  real.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In early 2024, Jake drove up Palomar Mountain for the first time.
                  He stood at the summit, looked west toward the Pacific glinting in
                  the distance, looked east toward the desert, looked at the
                  observatory dome against the sky, and had one of those moments where
                  an idea goes from &ldquo;that would be cool&rdquo; to &ldquo;I am going
                  to do this.&rdquo; He called Tias Capital from the car on the way down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tias Capital, the investment firm behind several successful
                  hospitality and outdoor recreation ventures, saw what Jake saw: an
                  underserved market, a mountain with real bones, and a story too good
                  not to tell. They backed the project, and Mirage Mountain Resort was
                  born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The name came later, over beers. &ldquo;Mirage&rdquo; because the
                  whole thing feels like it shouldn&apos;t be real. A ski resort in San
                  Diego? Next to a world-famous observatory? With palm trees in the
                  parking lot? It sounds like a mirage. But the snow is real. The
                  mountain is real. And on December 18, 2026, the lifts start turning.
